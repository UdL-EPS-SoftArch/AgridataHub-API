## Vision

**For** data reusers **who** want to conduct a data analysis (with a defined scope and motivation)
and **for** data providers **who** want to share their data (under certain conditions)

**the project** AgridataHub **is a** platform to share and request datasets taking into account stakeholders' interests

**that** allows uploading datasets, describing, searching, browsing, requesting and granting access to them

**Unlike** existing tools, AgridataHub takes into account the EU Code of Conduct about agricultural data sharing and reuse
